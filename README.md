# Student-s-Brainrot
Developed a machine learning model to predict students' academic performance using features like study hours, sleep patterns, screen time, physical activity, and class attendance. The goal is to uncover how daily behavior impacts academic outcomes and to assist students in optimizing their routines for better results.
